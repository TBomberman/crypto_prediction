BidAskJan2014-Feb2017.csv <- this is old data that I have downloaded before
CandlesJan2015-Dec217.csv <- 15min candles for the last 2 years
ProcessedCandlesJan2015-Dec217.csv <- same as previous with the first column removed, due to numpy cannot read first col, last column is buy/sell: 1/0 labels, sorted ascending

keras_test_lstm.py runs perfectly fine

Todo:
convert prices to % change

Good luck guys
